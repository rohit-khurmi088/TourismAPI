//====================
// VIRTUAL PROPERTIES
//====================
-> fields that we define on our schema but they are not saved in the database
-> saves space
-> derived from one another (Eg: conversion from miles to km) - not need to save both fields in the databse
->not part of database => cannot be used with a query
-> seprates businesslogic from application logic

Virtual Property - containing tour duration in weeks
//current tour duration - numbers

const schema = new mongoose.Schema({
    //duration
    duration:{
        type:Number,
        required:[true, 'A Tour must have a duration']
    },
},{
    //Defining Schema to get Virtual_Properties in output
    toJSON: {virtuals:true},
    toObject:{virtuals:true}
});

//converting days to weeks (duration)
tourSchema.virtual('durationWeeks').get(function(){
